It is designed to last forever; we understand that everyone will love to earn money every 15 days. We will like to inform you that this Community will last forever if only everyone makes a New Pledge to Provide another Help after they have Received Help knowing that the new Help you pledged to Provide will bring in another 100% in 15 days. It will keep the community running forever. ZP also implemented some featured to keep this in check.</p>
					<p>
					<ul class='ulstyle'>
					<li>After receiving Help, a Participant is given a maximum of 48 hours to make another Pledge to Provide Help. If no new pledge is made after 48 hours from receiving help, the system will commence debiting of your Credibility score. Please note that accounts with credibility score of zero(0) will be automatically blocked. All we need in this community are people who are active and have the Mind Set to Give and in turn Receive. We need people that will make this community last forever.
					<li>Feel the joy of giving when you see the face of who you are Providing Help to. This will help Participants make friends all over the World. A Real Social Financial Platform with Sincere people Changing Lives, Changing Nations and Changing the World.
