                              There are three ways at which one can participate;
						<ul style='color: #000; font-size: 12px;'>
						<li>1. It is suggested that, upon invitation to join, the sponsor must have your full name, email ID and mobile number to fill out the registration form. On successful registration, SMS and Email message be sent containing your email ID and mobile number (both as a username), and a generated password. The password and username are subject to change when logged in.
						</li>
						<li>2. The referral link is the invite’s analogue, but it is more convenient to attract new members through the Internet (Facebook, Twitter etc.). A person coming to the system through your referral link will be automatically redirected to ZENITHPLUS register page. After registering he is assigned to a sponsor and a token fee is added to your profile in which you can cash out later.
						</li>
						<li>3. In the event that you were not invited by anyone, then you can join by going to https://www.zenitplus.org and click on the Sign-Up. You will be systematically referred directly by the Administrator and the system will automatically assign you to a member.</li>

                            ZENITHPLUS is a multi-level social network marketing where people who are willing to help each other voluntarily, will join with their bio-data. And the registered members of ZENITHPLUS have a unified financial relationship, and this has proven the reason why ZENITHPLUS is not a subject of legal relations and so the ZENITHPLUS community cannot be illegal. Giving money by one participant to another one is not prohibited by either international or local legal systems.
