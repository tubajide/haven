                     <div class="text"><p>Credibility Score index is a custom rating logic integrated into the system which determines the rate at which the system merges you to receive payment, it is implemented to ensure fair-play and honesty . Each new account is started with 100% rating. However, penalties are enforced when guidelines are broken, which lead to the deduction of score point and the participant loses his or her credibility. This is to ensure all members act and respond according to the guidelines of the community. </p>
					 <p>
					 <b>Key Guidelines / Penalties include the following</b>
					 <ul class="ulstyle">
					<li>If you are paired and you contact the money-receiving member, asking for a 24hr time extension to make payment, once he/she approves in his account, you will lose 25% of your credibility score.
					<li>If you offer to provide help and you cancel the offer (before you are paired), 5% score point will be deducted from your Credibility score card.
					<li>If discovered that your profile contains wrong profile picture/ information, 50% will be deducted.
					<li>If you fail to provide help to a paired member and expiry date elapses, your Credibility Score will be wiped out to Zero (0), which leads to automatic profile suspension.
					<li>Account/Profile suspension means you will no longer be able to place or receive help from this platform, for resolution, please send an email to support@zennithplus.org 
					</ul>
					
					Finally, please note that Credibility Score value is a key input for the “automatic pairing and assigning control system”; this system is solely responding for matching requests to offers. Members with higher Credibility Score will have higher priority for pairing
